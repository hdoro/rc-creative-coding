### Random Emojis & Turn of the Century Female Artists
Using a Stable Diffusion 1.0 pipe with standard settings we paired random female artists from the 1870's and early 1900's with random emojis related to the Creative Coding prompts. It didn't know what to do with a lot of the artists and leaned towards generic outputs about 50% of the time but usually interpreted the emoji correctly. About 1 in 5 output images were super interesting works of art in their own right, regardless of how faithfully they interpreted the artist's style.  ![a 🐣 in the style of Frances Benjamin Johnston](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28816983/205160145-f8980e32-f6e4-49ec-bfc8-aa25fa5d2666.png) "a 🐣 in the style of Frances Benjamin Johnston"  ![a 🥭 in the style of Anna Page Scott](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28816983/205160334-1714cdd6-1b19-4c01-abf1-3141364f6005.png) "a 🥭 in the style of Anna Page Scott"  ![a 🍲 in the style of Elsa Thiemann](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28816983/205160408-b0eba709-4583-4fea-8cc2-44dc6cdf1a0b.png) "a 🍲 in the style of Elsa Thiemann"
